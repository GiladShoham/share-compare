# share-compare
Helping you select sharing component toolchain - Bit, Lerna, Yarn workspaces

# Intro
The purpose of this repo is to help you select the best tool chain to share your component library inside your organization or publicly.
The project contain 2 parts: 
* Hands on part - this part will guide you step by step from cloning the project to the final result of each tool. This way you will not only *read* about it, but *feel* it.
* Theoretical part - This part will review some of the advantages and disadvantes of each tool to help you summery the findings in a more organize way. It will also cover some features that are not part of the hands on part (it's just too much to include all features).

*Disclaimer:*
Some of this tools requires a massive refactor to apply on your own library. In this project we pre structured it in a way to best fit for each tool to save you this time and keep the instuctions short as possible. We will talk about the refactor in the theoretical part.

# Compareing factors
In order to make the compare more orgnaized we will focus on some common chalanges, every one come to share a component library are faced.
